# SleepSmarter

SleepSmarter is a health tracking application that allows doctors to monitor their patients' sleep data, including heart rate and movement. The application is designed to help identify any anomalies in the sleep patterns of patients, allowing doctors to make more informed decisions about treatment and care.
The app is meant to be used with the wristband created by the group in order to track the data with a heartrate sensor and an accelerometer.
## Features
- Tracks heart rate and movement during sleep from the data given by the wristband
- Allows doctors to view and analyze patient data
- Identifies any anomalies in sleep patterns
- Easy to use interface for both patients and doctors

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/clapathiotis/SleepSmarter.git`
2. Edit is as you like on your IDE
3. Create your apk file to be able to download it on your phone

## Usage
1. Patients are required to wear a wristband that tracks their heart rate and movement during sleep.
2. The data is then synced to the SleepSmarter application, where it is analyzed and presented to the doctor in an easy-to-read format.
3. The doctor can then use this information to make more informed decisions about treatment and care for the patient.

## Future plans
- Integration with other health tracking devices such as smartwatches and fitness trackers
- Adding more data points for analysis, such as sleep stages
- Developing machine learning algorithms to automatically identify and flag potential sleep disorders

## Contribution
We welcome any contributions to the project, whether it is a bug report, feature request, or a pull request.
